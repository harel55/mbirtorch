MBIRTorch: Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) for tomographic reconstruction using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). 

Features include:
* Multiple geometries:  parallel beam, cone beam (including curved detector and helical), translation mode, and multi-axis parallel. 
* 4D reconstruction: a time sequence of volumes from a single continuous scan, using multi-agent consensus equilibrium (MACE).
* Preprocessing routines for NSI and Zeiss scanners, plus geometry calibration.
* Utilities for metal artifact reduction and stripe removal.  
* Hyperspectral neutron data: maximum-likelihood dehydration into component maps and spectra, denoising, and the `mbirtorch-hsnt` command line ([documentation](https://mbirtorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usr_hsnt.html)).
* Interactive slice and geometry viewers.
* Informative demos and extensive documentation. 
* Seamless operation on 1 or more GPUs, Mac MPS, or CPU. 
* Compiled torch and Triton kernels for efficiency.

Available on PyPI via 
```bash
pip install mbirtorch
```

Reconstruct in one line:
```python
import mbirtorch
recon, recon_dict = mbirtorch.recon_simple_parallel(sinogram, angles)
```
